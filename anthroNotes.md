### **Class and Mobility**
#### **Class:**
**_Class_ is a distinct expression of inequality.**
There is a range of patterns of inequality across cultures;

_e.g_ - **Egalitarian** societies vs. **Ranked** societies.

**Classes** are based on hierarchies of economic roles and social status, and initially appear with intensive agricultural societies;

_e.g_ - Egypt, China, Mesoamerica, Andes

*Pre-industrial* class systems tend to lack social mobility and have only a few recognized categories:

_e.g_ - Rulers/nobles, priests, warriors, merchants, **peasants**. 

#### **Class Transformations:**
_Agricultural classes_ are transformed by emergence of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. Happened first in Britain, then across Europe and the U.S., then Japan. This led to an _Advent of factories, wage-work, and production for markets_.

These **transformations** led to prominent accounts by philosophers and early social scientists.
A key thinker was ***Karl Marx***, a German philosopher in the mid-late 19<sup>th</sup> century.
_Marx_ argued that key class conflict in capitalism was between:

**Proletariat** - Urban factory wage _workers_.

**Bourgeoisie** - A _capitalist_ class of _owners_ who lived off profits.

The two classes had directly opposed interests in the price of labor (wages).
The _proletariats_ wanted higher wages so they would make more money and the _bourgeoisie_ wanted lower wages so they would make more money.

#### **Key Thinkers**:
Another key thinker was ***Max Weber***, and early sociologist in the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
_Weber_ built directly on the work of _Marx_, but gave more attention to cultural and social aspects.
Weber thought the key role was education and **prestige** - social standing partially distinct from economic resources.
He proposed that Economic class and prestige are sometimes comparable, but are separate and much of one may be had without the other.
For example, _Educators_ may have _prestige_, but they may not be wealthy.
Essentially: **Prestige/Respect** does not necessarily equate to being **Wealthy/High Economic Status**.

One more key thinker was ***Pierre Bourdieu***, a French anthropologist/sociologist in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century.
He did fieldwork in Morocco and France, but he focused on the class system in France. He was concerned with issues of _class **reproduction**_.
The conceptes he was involved with: **Habitus** and **social** and **cultural capital**.

The final key thinker is ***Kimberl√© Crenshaw***, a contemporary legal scholar.
_Crenshaw_ is associated the the concept of **intersectionality**, or inequality along multiple axes - e.g. class, race, economic status, etc. and how they're connected.

#### **Class and Mobility in Latin America**
Large regions organized from ancient times along agricultural class systems.
They were later brought into the colonial global economy with trade of sugar, silver, other colonial products; using enslaved and coerced labor.
By independence - more commercial orientation.

Many areas began _industrialization_ through the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
This _industrialization_ caused a growth of urban centers and workers, and a large-scale migration from rural areas to create huge cities.
These large cities had a pattern of massive slums surrounding the large cities in order to house all the labor.

Crisis and economic integration in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century brought waves of migration north to the U.S. and Canade.
E.g. _Bracero_ program of 1940s-1960s to address labor shortages during and after WWII.
Later waves of migration are tied to neoliberal policies from the 1970s and after.
E.g. NAFTA - Northat American Free Trade Agreement, 1994 - followed by several other through the next decades.
