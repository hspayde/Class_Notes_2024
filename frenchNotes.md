### **Adverbs**
To form an adverb from an adjective whose masculine singular form ends in a consonant, add **-ment** to the feminine singular form.
*e.g. actif -> active -> activement.*
If it ends with a vowel in masculine singular, just add a -ment.
*e.g. absolu -> absolument.*
If it ends with -ent or -ant, drop the -ent/-ant and add **-emment** or **-amment**.
*e.g constament -> constam -> constamemment.*

Some adverbs are formed by adding **-ément** to the masculine singulare. Those adverbs are confus, énorme, précis, et profond.
Some other exceptions are mauvais and meilleur, their adverbs are mal and mieux.

Most common adverbs can be grouped by category: Time, manner, opinion, place, and quantity.
Adverbs go **before** the verb they are describing.
